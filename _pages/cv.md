# Software Engineering Projects

### ODUConnect - Software Engineering Team Project
An interactive web app to connect industry professionals with mentoring opportunities at ODU.
* Built continuous deployment pipelines.
* Led the front-end design, including process flows, UX, UI, and database requirements.
* Developed and deployed a REST API in Flask.
* Broke front end components into discrete tasks and assigned to team members with instructions and tutorials to implement in ReactJS.
* Presented functional prototype to an industry review board

[Check it out on my projects page!](../portfolio/project08-oduconnect)

### PySwarms Open Source Contribution
Open source contributions to a particle swarm optimization researchlibrary in Python.
* Created new objective functions for benchmarking and improved existing ones, along with full unit test coverage.
* Discovered opportunity to improve visualization with Pyplot gradients and submitted the feature as a separate pull request.
* Delivered code conforming to contribution guidelines and project style

### CPU Temperature Approximation
An approximation and interpolation application with matrix solvermodule.
* Developed algorithms for matrix solver and cubic spline, linear least squares, and piece-wise interpolation.
* Created unit tests and documentation.
* Wrote application in Python.

# Data Science Projects

### Toxic Comment Classification
Analysis and modeling of Wikipedia comments.
* Performed a statistical analysis of comment data to inform data processing, feature engineering, and ML strategies.
* Created and tested new features using benchmark models.
* Developed a Support Vector Machine model incorporating a custom Naive Bayes weight feature transformer that effectively identified toxic comments.

### Galaxy Zoo Challenge - Image Classification with PyTorch
Describe galaxies with space telescope data.
* Created a data processing pipeline that extracts the region of interest from images and transforms data into Pytorch tensors.
* Developed a convolutional neural network that accurately describes images and achieves goal root mean-square error.

### Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge on Kaggle
I built an ensembling algorithm that trains models in a sequence, using the output of multiple models as features in an ensemble model that predicted the prices of items based on their prices and scored in the top 18% in the Kaggle challenge.
