# Projects

### ODUConnect - Software Engineering Team Project
An interactive web app to connect industry professionals with mentoring opportunities at ODU.
* Built continuous deployment pipelines.
* Led the front-end design, including process flows, UX, UI, and database requirements.
* Developed and deployed a REST API in Flask.
* Broke front end components into discrete tasks and assigned to team members with instructions and tutorials to implement in ReactJS.
* Presented functional prototype to an industry review board
