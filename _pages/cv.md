# Projects

### Toxic Comment Classification
I analyzed a public database of Wikipedia comments and used the insights I extracted to build a Support Vector Machine classifier model incorporating Naive Bayes feature weighting to effectively predict whether a given comment is toxic.

### PySwarms Open Source Contribution
In response to a GitHub issue posted by the developers of PySwarms, a particle swarm optimization library, I implemented many new objective functions and updated a few existing ones, covering my contributions with new unit tests. I also improved the plotter module by adding support for Pyplot color gradients and fixed a performance issue, which I submitted as a separate pull request.

### Galaxy Zoo Challenge - Image Classification with PyTorch
I used insights that I gained from analyzing images in the Galaxy Zoo dataset to develop a weighted MSE loss function that prevents dramatic gradient updated from sparse classes and uses OpenCV to extract the region of interest from each image. I then built a convolutional neural network (CNN) with PyTorch and trained it on the processed data to predict the confidence level of crowdsourced human classifiers.

### ODUConnect - Software Engineering Team Project
I led the front end development of a ReactJS web app to connect industry professionals with mentoring opportunities at ODU. I built the framework and continuous deployment pipeline and broke the work down into tasks which I assigned to team members, and I developed a REST API in Flask to connect the front end to an MSSQL database.

### CPU Temperature Approximation
I built a matrix solver module from scratch and implemented cubic spline, linear least squares, and linear piecewise interpolation to approximate CPU temperature time series data using test driven development.

### Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge on Kaggle
I built an ensembling algorithm that trains models in a sequence, using the output of multiple models as features in an ensemble model that predicted the prices of items based on their prices and scored in the top 18% in the Kaggle challenge.
