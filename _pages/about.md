**tl;dr** – I’m the software engineer you’re looking for! I earned a B.S. in Computer Science with a 3.94 GPA, I’ve led multiple software engineering projects to a successful delivery, I love the tech stuff from math and DSA to git and unit testing, and I have over a decade of experience in marketing, communication, and teaching. **I can solve problems, I can build things, and I can communicate effectively.**

A Long Introduction
===============

Thanks for visiting my portfolio website! You can dive deeper to see some of the cool stuff I’ve been working on, but I’d also like to give you a brief picture of who I am.

My path to software engineering has been far from typical. I’ve always had a passion for math and science, yet I struggled with communication. I started college as a physics major, and while the courses were interesting and I good grades I felt like I wasn’t really developing as a person. So I did something crazy, I switch my major to English and forced myself dramatically outside of my comfort zone by joining the school newspaper, taking an internship in publishing, and pursuing every opportunity to develop my communications skills. Compared to my physics courses, English was a brutally difficult major. But it paid off.

Throughout college I worked for The Speidell Group (my father’s business) as a Special Project Manager, taking on a variety of projects from developing marketing content to managing a software automation project. After graduation I threw myself further outside of my comfort zone, spending three years teaching in Korea. It was a big transition, but I quickly learned to thrive in that role and it ended up being the most fulfilling work I’ve done in my life.

When I came back to the US, I worked for The Speidell Group for a year until I moved to Seattle and started my current role at Momentum. As the Sales and Marketing Coordinator and now Marketing Manager, I wear a wide variety of hats and quickly learned to develop and deliver on strategies that build our brand presence and bring in new opportunities.

Today I’ve come full circle. A few years ago I got into programming as a hobby. A month in and I had built [a flying shooter game in Python](https://github.com/jayspeidell/super-moon-attack){:target="_blank"}, and after that I worked through online code challenges and a data structures and algorithms textbook implementing everything in C. I even contributed to a cool open source Python library. Then I discovered machine learning and Kaggle, and after completing a number of projects I decided it was time to go back to school and turn this hobby into a career.

In August I graduated with a Computer Science degree. In only two years, and while working full time, I blew through the entire CS program at Old Dominion University earning a 3.94 GPA. The only grade I earned below an A was a B+ in Theoretical Computer Science while I was stubbornly keeping up with my coursework while recovering from back surgery without painkillers.

While working towards my degree I strove to be the best in every aspect of software engineering, not just programming. I took charge of group projects, creating a vision for successful delivery and breaking the work down into discrete tasks that I could assign to team members along with instructions and documentation for delivering on those tasks. I went overboard with the software engineering process even in math courses, delivering fully documented and unit tested applications with build automation with bonus features that went above and beyond the requirements.

I want to be the best at what I do. I want to tackle increasingly difficult problems, work with brilliant people who I can learn from, and collaborate with other motivated team members to deliver cool projects. But in order to do that, I need an opportunity to join a high-performing team.
