Thanks for visiting my portfolio website! You can dive deeper to see some of the cool stuff I’ve been working on, but I’d also like to give you a brief picture of who I am.

My path to software engineering has been far from typical. I originally earned a degree in English and became a teacher, then I built a career in marketing. Though I love what I do and excel in the field, my hobbies led me to discover a passion for programming, software engineering, and machine learning. After developing these skills for a couple years I went back to school and earned a Computer Science degree graduating Summa Cum Laude in only two years. 

I believe I bring a unique mix of skills to the table. Not only do I have demonstrated technical proficiency and problem solving skills, I also have skills in business and communication that enable me to ask the right questions to connect a project deliverable to its purpose and effectively convey insights I’ve uncovered.  

If I sound like a great fit for your organization, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:jayspeidell@gmail.com">jayspeidell@gmail.com</a>.
