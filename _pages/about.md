I'm a sales and marketing professional in Seattle pursuing continuing education to transition to and build a career in data science. For the past three years I've been teaching myself programming, math, statistics, and machine learning. I'm also studying Computer Science at Old Dominion University with an expected graduation date of August 2020.

In what little free time I have you'll find me doing Kaggle competitions, 3D printing, hiking, and mountain biking!

While you're here, check out a sample of projects I've worked on and my 3D printed trail maps!

Resume available upon request.
