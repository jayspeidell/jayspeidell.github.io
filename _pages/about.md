Thanks for visiting! This is a personal website that I use for sharing information around my hobbies as well as hosting my professional portfolio and resume. 

If you’re here related to my current job search, click over to the resume tab to view or download the latest version of my resume and swing by the Projects tab to see my portfolio. 

My blog features a broad assortment of niche topics and is meant for linking entries directly rather than general consumption, but feel free to browse it to see some of my interests outside of work.
