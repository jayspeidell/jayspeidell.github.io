Thanks for visitng my portfolio website! I'm a graduating Computer Science major ready to kick off my new career! I've spent the last four year independently studying math, stats, programming, and machine learning alongside pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at Old Dominion University.

I built this website to to give you an idea of the skills I've developed, the technologies and frameworks I've learned, and the projects I've completed. Check out the Projects and Resume tabs to learn more and see how I can add value to your data science team.

I'd also like to add some additional context that might not come across on paper. I come from a marketing background, and I'm continuing to work full time as a Marketing Manager as I pursue my education. I've also worked as a teacher for several years before that. This gives me a unique perspect and a power combination of technology and communication skills.

And while you're here, check out my 3D printed trail maps!
