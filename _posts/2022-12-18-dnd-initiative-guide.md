I wanted a vertical initiative tracker with wet/dry erase labels and enough space to hold a dozen or so trackers for when lots of people show up at the game show. I couldn't find many options, so I came up with this using mostly stuff I had around the house.

# What you need:

- Base (any block of wood)
- 1/4 inch dowel
- Clothespins
- Dry erase magnets (Not using the magnets, but this is the only way I could find very small and semi-rigid dry erase material.) [Amazon Link (not affiliate)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0983VRBTD)
- Sandpaper
- Hot glue gun or other adhesive
- Drill with 1/4 inch bit

# Steps

1. Drill out the base and insert the dowel. Use the same size drill bit as your dowel for a snug fit. <img src="/images/minis/init-drill.jpg" style="width:100%" />

2. **Sandpaper** the magnets. This is vital, as adhesives will not stick to a smooth magnet. The hot glue sticks well after the surface has been roughened up.

3. Glue a magnet on each side of the clothespins. <img src="/images/minis/init-glue.jpg" style="width:100%" />

4. Play D&D! This is a pretty easy project. I mainly just wanted to share the idea.
